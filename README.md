# ShopwareDevDigest

The purpose of this repository is to allow everybody to add content to be published at a monthly Shopware developer digest as a blog post at [https://www.shopware.com/en/news/developer-insights/?search=digest](https://www.shopware.com/en/news/developer-insights/?search=digest).

The content may contain blogposts, podcasts, videos and open source extensions that might be interesting for all other Shopware developers like tutorials, how-to's, challanges of your latest projects, open source extensions and so on. Just everything good to exchange experience.

What is _not_ intended to be published in this digest:

* User documentation (how to change my logo)
* Marketing for your own implementation agency 
* Marketing for your commercial plugins
* Comparisons with other shopping cart systems (because basically _all of these comparisons_ are lame)
* Job ads
* Press releases

So you got the point? We are pleased to merge your own content or the one you accidently found: let us build a knowledge pool together! 

And help these poor individuals who check Talkwalker, Google Alerts and other resources presently on an every day basis, which actually is a labour for somebody who killed his mom and dad, innit? :D
